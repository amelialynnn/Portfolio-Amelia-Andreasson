# Amelia Andreasson :woman_technologist:

I am a creative student who has changed career paths from finance & marketing to front-end development - and I don't regret it for a second!

As I start my third semester at IT-HÃ¶gskolan in Gothenburg this fall, it is time for my first internship period, which will take place from **August 22nd to October 14th**.

I am a person eager to learn, who enjoys working with things that require problem solving. With experinece in HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Vue.js, Node.js, version control with Git as well as working with agile methods, such as Scrum and Kanban, I am ready to transform my theoretical knowledge into practical skills!

Before starting my intership, I will have completed the following courses:

- HTML & CSS
- Native JavaScript
- UX & UI Design - Figma
- JavaScript with Frameworks - Vue.js
- Agile Development - Git, Scrum
- Full Stack Development - Node.js, Express, React, TypeScript
