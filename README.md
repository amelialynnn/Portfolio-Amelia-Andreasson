# Amelia Andreasson :woman_technologist:

I am a creative student who has changed career paths from finance & marketing to front-end development – and I don't regret it for a second!

As I start my fourth and final semester at IT-Högskolan in Gothenburg this spring, it is time for my second internship period, which will take place from January 23 to May 12.

I am an eager learner, who enjoys working with things that require problem solving. With experience in HTML, CSS, JavaScript, version control with Git as well as working with Vue and React, I am ready to transform my theoretical knowledge into practical skills!

Before starting my internship, I will have completed the following courses:

- HTML & CSS
- Native JavaScript
- UX & UI Design - Figma
- JavaScript with Frameworks - Vue.js
- Agile Development - Git, Scrum
- Full Stack Development - Node.js, Express, React, TypeScript
- Project management
- CMS development
